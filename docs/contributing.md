## Contributing

Pull requests or issues are welcome.

- After adding tests in `tests` for a new feature or a bug fix, please run the test suite.
- To do so, the only additional dependencies needed beyond those for the package can be 
installed with:

  ```pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt```
  
- Once those are installed, the tests can be run with `pytest`. Alternatively, 
`python setup.py test` can be used.
